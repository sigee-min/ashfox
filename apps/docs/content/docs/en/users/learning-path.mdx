title: Learning Path
description: A guided reading order that connects setup, workflows, and execution details.
---

If the docs feel too task-first, follow this page as the primary reading order. The goal is to understand why each step exists before you jump into playbooks or tool-level schemas.

Start with Installation and Getting Started so your local runtime is stable. Then read the Blockbench Plugin Guide or Ashfox Guide depending on whether you are authoring assets in Blockbench or operating services for external clients. Once the flow is clear, use Tool Reference for precise field contracts and keep Troubleshooting nearby for failure recovery.

This order gives you context first, execution second. Task playbooks remain useful for fast delivery, but they work best after you already understand the workflow boundaries.
