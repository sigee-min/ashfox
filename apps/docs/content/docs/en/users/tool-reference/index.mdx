title: Tool Reference
description: Category-based reference with one dedicated page per ashfox MCP tool.
---

This reference is structured so you can read quickly at category level and then drop into exact tool contracts when implementation details matter. Every tool page describes the schema, field behavior, and practical request/response shape expected by the current runtime.

Use category pages to understand sequencing and responsibility boundaries first, then move into individual tool pages while wiring client logic. This approach reduces integration mistakes because you keep workflow context and schema details together.
