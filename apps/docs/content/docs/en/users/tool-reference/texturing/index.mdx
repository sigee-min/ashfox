description: Texture assignment, paint operations, and texture state inspection.
---

Texturing tools control how surfaces are mapped and painted. You can inspect texture assets, bind textures to targets, apply paint operations, and remove unused textures when the asset is cleaned up.

For reliable output, keep texture operations close to the modeling or UV step they belong to. This prevents drift between geometry updates and the texture state used during validation and export.
