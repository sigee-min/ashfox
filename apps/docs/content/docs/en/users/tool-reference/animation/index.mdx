description: Clip and keyframe tools for deterministic animation workflows.
---

Animation tools are organized around clip lifecycle and keyframe authoring. You can create, update, and delete clips, then apply pose or trigger keyframes in a controlled timeline sequence.

In production pipelines, deterministic animation behavior depends on stable clip identifiers, explicit frame values, and consistent sequencing between pose and trigger channels. The pages below describe each operation at field level.
