title: Project Tools
description: Project lifecycle, validation, preview, and export tools.
---

Project tools define the outer lifecycle of a session. You establish or reuse a project context, inspect state, run validation, render previews for visual checks, and export results or trace logs when the session is complete.

In most client implementations, these tools are called at phase boundaries rather than during every micro-step. This keeps workflow state explicit and makes failures easier to diagnose.
