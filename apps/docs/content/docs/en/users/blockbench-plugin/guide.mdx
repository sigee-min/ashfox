description: Narrative guide for creators working directly in Blockbench Desktop.
---

This guide is for creators who build assets directly in Blockbench and want a stable path from first setup to export-ready output. The emphasis is workflow clarity: you should know what to do at each phase and why that phase exists.

Begin by confirming plugin installation and MCP connectivity. Once the connection is stable, define your modeling scope and structure first, then move to texture mapping and painting, and only then finalize animation edits. Validation and preview should happen before export so that format issues are caught early.

Use task playbooks when you already know which operation you need right now. If you are still deciding sequence, stay in this guide and the cross-cutting Guides section until the flow feels predictable.
