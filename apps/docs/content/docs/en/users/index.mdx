description: Start with guided context, then move into workflow and execution details.
---

This section is organized to reduce task-only reading. The recommended path is to understand context first, then move into operational details when you are ready to execute.

Read `Learning Path` if you want a complete sequence from setup to export. Then choose either the Blockbench Plugin or Ashfox track based on your environment. After the flow is clear, use Tool Reference and Troubleshooting as implementation support.
