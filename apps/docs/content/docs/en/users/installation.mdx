description: Install Ashfox and verify MCP endpoint connectivity.
---

Installation should leave you with a repeatable runtime where Blockbench, the Ashfox plugin, and your MCP client can communicate without manual patching between sessions. The recommended path is to install the latest plugin release first, confirm connectivity, and only then switch to source builds if you need custom development.

For a release-based setup in Blockbench Desktop, open `File > Plugins > Load Plugin from URL`, paste the plugin URL below, and load it.

```text
https://github.com/sigee-min/ashfox/releases/latest/download/ashfox-bbplugin.js
```

If you are developing or testing local changes, clone from source and build the plugin yourself.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sigee-min/ashfox.git
cd ashfox
npm install
npm run build
```

If the repository is already present, run only the install and build steps.

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

After building, load `dist/ashfox-bbplugin.js` through the Blockbench Plugin Manager. When the plugin is active, verify endpoint connectivity from your MCP client using the default endpoint `http://127.0.0.1:8787/mcp` and call `list_capabilities`. A successful response should include tool schemas and `toolRegistry.hash`, which confirms that your client is reading the active server contract.

Runtime endpoint parameters can be overridden with `ASHFOX_HOST`, `ASHFOX_PORT`, and `ASHFOX_PATH` when you need a non-default local setup.

```bash
ASHFOX_HOST=127.0.0.1
ASHFOX_PORT=8787
ASHFOX_PATH=/mcp
```

Use `https://ashfox.sigee.xyz` as the official documentation entry point when sharing setup instructions with teammates.
